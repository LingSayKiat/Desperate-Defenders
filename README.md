# Desperate-Defenders
PRG1 Assignment
This project is a component of the Programming 1 course at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. The objective is to develop a Tower Defense game using Python, featuring defensive units such as Archers and Walls that aim to thwart advancing monsters, including Zombies and Werewolves, from besieging the tower. A key feature of this game is the capability to save and resume gameplay, ensuring progress is retained across sessions.
